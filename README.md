# FPGA_ML_Accelerator
## Contributors: Dhruv Jha
### This project is based on the implementation of ML models on the FPGA boards. We have used kintex-7 Genesys 2 and PYNQ z2 Board.

### We will be using Vitis HLS 2023 version for making the .bit and .tcl file for the model specific hardware design. 
### Resources for ViT study -

- [Vitis HLS](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1399-vitis-hls/Tutorials-and-Examples)

### The first project i did in vitis HLS was array addition. The cpp file for source and testbench have been added along with the header file.
